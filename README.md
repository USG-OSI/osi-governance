# USG Open Source Initiative  
## Governance & Participation Framework

Welcome to the official governance repository of the **USG Open Source Initiative (OSI)**.

This repository defines the principles, policies, and standards that guide all projects developed under the USG Open Source Initiative.

The goal of OSI is to build sustainable, collaborative, student-led open-source projects that extend beyond coursework and continue evolving over time.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Participation & Project Agreement  
- Governance principles  
- Contribution expectations  
- Licensing standards  
- Community conduct guidelines  

All participants — including project owners, maintainers, and contributors — are expected to review and agree to these guidelines before joining OSI projects.
